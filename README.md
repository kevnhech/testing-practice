# testing-practice
Write tests for the following, and then make the tests pass!
1. A `capitalize` function that takes a string and returns it with the first character capitalized.
2. A `reverseString` function that takes a string and returns it reversed.
3. A `calculator` object that contains functions for the basic operations: `add`, `subtract`, `divide`, and `multiply`. Each of these functions should take two numbers and return the correct calculation.
4. A `caesarCipher` function that takes a string and a shift factor and returns it with each character “shifted”.
5. An `analyzeArray` function that takes an array of numbers and returns an object with the following properties: `average`, `min`, `max`, and `length`.
```
const object = analyzeArray([1,8,3,4,2,6]);

object == {
   average: 4,
   min: 1,
   max: 8,
   length: 6
};
```
